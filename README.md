Flutter mobile app project specifically tailored for mine and my SO needs regarding managing our chores. Aside from static avatars - application can be used without changing anything by any person or duo wanting to manage their chores (in Polish)

Should you want to try to run and modify app: before doing so you need to [configure FlutterFire - and connect app to your own Firebase Project](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup?hl=en&platform=android)
